# weather_app


# About

- For this project, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

- When you enter your location, the temperatures will be displayed using Fahrenheit. To see in Celsius, just click the Celsius button. 

- The background images will change depending upon the weather description.

# Live Site

- [Weather App](https://god-lang.github.io/weather_app-main/)


# Source of code 

 - [@Asif](https://github.com/GOD-lang/weather_app-main) - I used this person's code because it was easier for me to follow and understand.
 
 - I did some things differently such as adding different images according to the weather, fahrenheit to celsius conversion, changed wind to miles per hour instead of kilometers per hour.
